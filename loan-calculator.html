                <h2>How Loan Payments Are Calculated</h2>

                <p>Understanding how your loan payment is calculated can help you make better financial decisions. This calculator uses the standard loan payment formula to determine your monthly payment amount.</p>

                <h3>The Loan Payment Formula</h3>
                <p>Monthly payments are calculated using this formula:</p>
                <div class="formula">
                    M = P[r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n-1]
                </div>
                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>M</strong> = Monthly payment</li>
                    <li><strong>P</strong> = Principal (loan amount)</li>
                    <li><strong>r</strong> = Monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12)</li>
                    <li><strong>n</strong> = Total number of payments (years × 12)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Understanding Amortization</h3>
                <p>With each payment you make, a portion goes toward interest and a portion goes toward the principal. Early in the loan, most of your payment goes toward interest. As time goes on, more of each payment goes toward reducing the principal balance.</p>

                <h3>Example Calculation</h3>
                <p>Let's say you borrow $250,000 at 6.5% interest for 30 years:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monthly payment: $1,580.17</li>
                    <li>Total interest over 30 years: $318,861.18</li>
                    <li>Total amount paid: $568,861.18</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This demonstrates why getting a lower interest rate or paying off your loan early can save you thousands of dollars.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is included in my monthly loan payment?</h3>
                    <p>Your monthly loan payment calculated here includes only principal and interest. For mortgages, your actual payment may also include property taxes, homeowners insurance, and possibly HOA fees or PMI (private mortgage insurance).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How can I lower my monthly payment?</h3>
                    <p>You can lower your monthly payment by: getting a lower interest rate, extending the loan term (though you'll pay more interest overall), making a larger down payment to reduce the loan amount, or improving your credit score before applying.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I choose a shorter or longer loan term?</h3>
                    <p>Shorter loan terms (like 15 years) have higher monthly payments but you'll pay much less interest over the life of the loan. Longer terms (like 30 years) have lower monthly payments but cost more in total interest. Choose based on your budget and financial goals.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is an amortization schedule?</h3>
                    <p>An amortization schedule is a table showing each loan payment over time, breaking down how much goes toward principal versus interest. It also shows your remaining balance after each payment.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I pay off my loan early?</h3>
                    <p>Most loans allow early payoff, but some have prepayment penalties. Check your loan terms. Paying extra toward principal can save you thousands in interest and help you become debt-free faster.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How accurate is this calculator?</h3>
                    <p>This calculator provides accurate estimates based on the standard amortization formula used by banks and lenders. However, actual payments may vary slightly based on how your lender calculates interest and whether there are additional fees or insurance costs.</p>
